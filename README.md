# CS-499---Capstone-

### Professional Self-Assessment
Throughout my time in the Computer Science program, I have grown into a confident and capable developer. This capstone project and the creation of this ePortfolio allowed me to integrate everything I’ve learned in the computer science program into a cohesive, real-world application. I’ve learned about software engineering, databases, teamwork, communication, and security. This program has strengthened my technical skills and has given me the clarity and confidence to enter the field of computer science with a clear vision for my future.

### Academic Journey and Skill Development
I have taken foundational courses in algorithms and data structures to advanced software development. Each course has helped me build technical and problem-solving skills. One example of this that is demonstrated in this project is that learning about search and sort algorithms would help me later improve the performance and scalability of my inventory app. My coursework in object-oriented programming, full-stack development, and mobile application development shaped my ability to develop clean, modular, and scalable code.
My experience with databases and software engineering principles in this program has been important. I became proficient in designing normalized relational schemas, implementing CRUD operations, and using SQLite for applications. These skills were important for my capstone because I implemented multi-table relationships and complex queries.
Through this program, I have developed strong security awareness. I understand the importance of validating inputs, preventing duplicate entries, and handling user data responsibly. Even basic features of this capstone were approached with a mindset focused on security and reliability.

### Collaboration, Communication, and Professional Values
For this capstone, I approached every step with collaboration and communication in mind. I documented my code, wrote clear code comments, and designed the user interface with stakeholders in mind. My background in education has helped me become a strong communicator. I am able to translate technical concepts into accessible language for non-technical audiences.
Throughout this program, I collaborated with peers through discussion boards and I collaborated with my instructors through instructor feedback. This helped simulate a real-world team environment. These experiences taught me how to receive and implement feedback, contribute ideas respectfully, and navigate shared responsibilities. The professional values of collaboration, ethical responsibility, and continuous improvement will guide me as I pursue a career in technology.

### Capstone Artifact Summary
This portfolio centers around my final Android application project: Franklin Inventory App. It is a fully functional mobile inventory management system, designed to handle real-world use cases like item tracking, user login, and audit logging. The app includes multiple enhancements in the categories of Software Design and Engineering, Algorithms and Data Structures, and Databases:

**[Software Design and Engineering:](https://github.com/D-Franklin-31/CS-499---Capstone-/tree/main/Enhancement%20Algorithms%20and%20Data%20Structures)**
- Improving the item inventory
- Edit quantity of items - tapping on a list item, updating the value without creating duplicates.
- Delete individual items – delete button to delete inventory items
- Clear all items – new ActionBar provides clear all items
- Login recovery – prompts user for email address for recovery
- Adjusting UI components to make the screens more professional


**Algorithms and Data Structures**
- O(1) lookup– implement an in-memory HashMap cache to allow constant-time lookups
- Search Function– added a real-time search capability using string filtering
- Sort Function- sorting algorithms for both name and quantity, with ascending and descending toggles
- Adding multiple items- developed a form that allows multiple inventory items to be added at once
- Validation Utilities- created a utility class that applies consistent input validation across the app
- UI design improvements- resolved layout issues where items were displaying behind the action bar and redesigned the button interface using a Gridlayout.

**Databases**
- Method for checking whether a user already exists when creating an account
- New action log table in the database
- New actionLogAdapter, actionLogActivity, and actionLog classes
- An activity_action_log.xml
- Updated the inventory table in the database class
- Created a method for if an item exist, duplicates will not be allowed.
- Each of these features demonstrates my ability to apply software engineering principles, database design, and user-centered development. These enhancements form a complete artifact that showcases my capability to take a project from concept to final release.
### Conclusion and Career Outlook
Completing the Computer Science program has given me a well-rounded skill set and the confidence to pursue opportunities in mobile development, software engineering, or data-driven applications. My goal is to transition from education into a career in Data Analytics. The skills I have learned throughout this program will help me transition into my new career. I can use these skills to develop meaningful solutions and contribute to innovative teams. This ePortfolio serves as both a reflection of my academic growth and a demonstration of my readiness for the professional world.
